          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            I was born in Orem, Utah, and lived there until I was about 3 years old. 
            We moved to Montana for about a year to be close to my maternal grandparents while my father looked for a new job.
            After I turned 4 we moved back to Utah to the city of Clearfield so my dad could start his new job. 
            We lived there for nearly 10 years, and then another new job brought our family to Washington State.
            There I attended high school and found a love of Computer Science before I graduated!</p>

          <p>
            After graduating High School I chose to serve a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
            I was assigned to serve in Salta, Argentina, and it was a wonderful experience in which I was able to learn a lot and help lots of people.
            I made so many new friends and was able to help many people grow their love of Christ, while personally growing much closer to him as well.

            In January 2020 I began attending BYU and studying Computer Science. 
            In February I met the love of my life, and we were married in the Mount Timpanogos Temple in May 2021.
            I am getting close to finishing my undergraduate degree, and I am enjoying every minute of it!
